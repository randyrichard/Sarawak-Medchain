# Executive Welcome Letter
## Sarawak MedChain Founding Partner Program

---

**CONFIDENTIAL - FOR SELECTED HEALTHCARE EXECUTIVES ONLY**

---

Dear Healthcare Leader,

On behalf of the entire Sarawak MedChain team, I am honored to extend this exclusive invitation to you.

---

## You Have Been Selected

After careful evaluation of healthcare facilities across Sarawak, your organization has been identified as one of only **10 hospitals** worthy of Founding Partner status in the Sarawak MedChain network.

This is not a mass invitation. This letter represents a handpicked selection of healthcare leaders who share our vision of a fraud-free, digitally-secured medical future for Sarawak.

**Your Founding Partner Number has been reserved.**

## The Security Promise

As a Founding Partner, your facility will be:

**The First in Your Region to Achieve:**

- **100% Data Integrity** - Every Medical Certificate cryptographically sealed on the blockchain
- **Zero Paper MC Fraud** - Eliminate the RM 2.3 billion annual fraud problem affecting Malaysian employers
- **Instant Verification** - Employers verify MCs in seconds via QR code, not phone calls
- **Tamper-Proof Audit Trail** - Every issuance permanently recorded, legally defensible

**Your patients trust you with their health. Now employers will trust you with their verification.**

While other facilities continue battling fake MCs and reputation damage, your hospital will stand as the gold standard of medical certificate integrity in your region.

## Your Lifetime Value Lock

As one of our 10 Founding Partners, you receive an unprecedented commitment:

| Benefit | Standard Rate | Your Founding Rate |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|

| Per MC Issued | *Subject to network costs* | **RM 1.00/MC** |
| Rate Lock Duration | Annual review | **LIFETIME** |

**This rate is locked forever.**

When the network expands to 50, 100, or 500 hospitals and operational costs increase, your rate remains unchanged. This is our thank you for believing in us first.

*Estimated annual savings vs. future standard rates: RM 24,000 - RM 60,000*

## Founding Partner Recognition

Your commitment will be permanently recognized:

1. **Gold "Founding Partner" Badge** - Displayed on your facility profile across the network
2. **Founding Partner #001-010 Seal** - Watermarked on every MC your doctors issue
3. **Founding Circle Showcase** - Featured on our public network page as a pioneer

## A Personal Note

We didn't build MedChain to be another software vendor. We built it because Sarawak deserves better than paper certificates that can be forged, faxed, and fabricated.

The hospitals that join us first aren't just customers - they're partners in transforming healthcare accountability across our state. Your name will be remembered as one of the first to take this stand.

I look forward to welcoming you to the Founding Circle.

With respect,

**Randy Richard**
Founder & CEO
Sarawak MedChain
