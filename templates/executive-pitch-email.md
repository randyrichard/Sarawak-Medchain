**Subject:** Your Hospital's MC Verification Problem Has a Blockchain Solution

---

Dear Dato'/Datin [CEO Name],

**The RM 2.3 Billion Problem Affecting Your Hospital**

Every year, Malaysian employers lose RM 2.3 billion to fraudulent medical certificates. As a hospital CEO, you know the reality: forged MCs don't just cost employers—they damage the reputation of legitimate healthcare providers like [Hospital Name].

When an employee presents a fake MC bearing your hospital's name, it's your credibility on the line.

**The Solution: Blockchain-Verified Medical Certificates**

Sarawak MedChain offers your hospital a dedicated blockchain node that makes MC forgery mathematically impossible:

| What You Get | Value |
|--------------|-------|
| **Dedicated Blockchain Node** | Your hospital's own secure presence on the network |
| **Unlimited Doctor Accounts** | Every physician, verified by SMC credentials |
| **Full ERP Integration** | Seamless connection to your existing systems |
| **QR Verification** | Employers scan, verify instantly—no phone calls |
| **Complete Audit Trail** | Every MC tracked, timestamped, immutable |

**Investment: RM 10,000/month + RM 1.00 per MC issued**

Your facility pays for itself by preventing just 30 fake MCs per month.

**We're Already Building the Network**

This isn't a pilot. **24 hospitals and 180+ private clinics** across Sarawak are currently being onboarded to form Malaysia's first blockchain-verified medical network. Early adopters are positioning themselves as the trusted standard.

**See It For Yourself**

I've prepared a **CEO Preview** of your specific terminal interface. No wallet or technical setup required—just click and explore:
